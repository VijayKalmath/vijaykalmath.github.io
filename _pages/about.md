I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at [Columbia University](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/) graduating in December 2022. 

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher  with Professor Michael Parrott on [AI Modelshare](https://www.modelshare.org/). 

Previously I worked as a Deep Learning Researcher with Dr.Igor Kadota at Columbia University working on Image Sequence Classification with ConvLSTM Models for Wind Speed Classification. 

My work and studies at Columbia have been mainly focused on Deep Learning from projects involving standard Convolutional Neural Networks , Creating custom tensorflow layers, Time Distributed ConvLSTMs to Language Models. 

I am currently focused on representation models and language models (mainly compression and adversarial attacks).

In spring 2022, I worked as a Course Assistant for the course Deep Learning and Neural Networks and Machine Learning Security in the Columbia AI Exec Program.

Before my Masters, I worked at Cisco in Bangalore, India for 3 Years as a Technical Consulting Engineer in the Software Defined Networking Domain and focused Linux based Distributed Computing platforms, DevOps Technologies like Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Computing with AWS and Azure. 

At Cisco, I got opportunities to work with many Cisco customers across the globe and got to mentor and ramp up multiple engineers for the Team.I led and developed around 30+ Automation Projects built upon Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch aimed at assisting troubleshooting for engineers and automating log analysis across technologies.

Aside from work, I am an avid fan of Formula 1 Racing and love participating in Quizzes !!
