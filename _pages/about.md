I am a Master of Data Science Student at Columbia University graduating in Decemeber 2022. 

I am currently working as a Deep Learning Research Assistant at Columbia University and am looking for full-time roles in the machine learning/ deep learning domain wherein I can combine my previous work experience and data science knowledge. 

My work and studies at Columbia has been mainly focused on Deep Learning from standard Convolutional Neural Networks , Time Distributed ConvLSTMs. My most recent project was on examing model compression techniques for BERT Models and their effects on model robustness.

Prior to my Masters , I worked in Cisco in Bangalore,India for 3 Years as a Techincal Consulting Engineer in the Software Defined Networking Domain and focused on DevOps Technologies like Docker,Kubernetes etc.. . I lead 25+ Automation Projects within Cisco built upon Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch.






Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
