I am a NLP - Machine Learning Engineer at [Lexalytics](https://www.lexalytics.com/), a leading multi-lingual AI company, My work is focused on deep learning research and large language models. 


I completed my Master of Science in Data Science at Columbia University in December 2022 and  I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of deep learning and NLP. 

At Columbia, I built my expertise in deep learning and NLP by :  

1. Developing [AI Modelshare](https://www.modelshare.ai/) as a Machine Learning Researcher under the supervision of Professor Michael Parrott.

2. Working as a Deep Learning Researcher with Dr. Igor Kadota, where I developed convLSTM models to predict micro-climate patterns based on radar transmission data.

3. Building course work as a Course Assistant for Deep Learning and Neural Networks as well as Machine Learning Security courses in the esteemed [Columbia AI Executive Program](https://ai.engineering.columbia.edu/).

My current research interests revolve around representation models and large language models, with a particular emphasis on model compression techniques and adversarial attacks.
