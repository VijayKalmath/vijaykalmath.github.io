As a Master's student in Data Science at Columbia University, set to graduate in December 2022, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher under the supervision of Professor Michael Parrott on the [AI Modelshare](https://www.modelshare.org/)project.

Previously, I held the position of Deep Learning Researcher with Dr. Igor Kadota at Columbia University, where I gained expertise in Image Sequence Classification utilizing ConvLSTM models for Wind Speed Classification.

Throughout my studies and work at Columbia, I have developed a strong focus on Deep Learning, with a particular emphasis on projects involving standard Convolutional Neural Networks, custom TensorFlow layers, Time Distributed ConvLSTMs, and Language Models. Currently, my research interests lie in the areas of representation models and language models, with a specific focus on model compression techniques and adversarial attacks.

In Spring 2022, I also served as a Course Assistant for the Deep Learning and Neural Networks and Machine Learning Security courses in the Columbia AI Executive Program, further solidifying my knowledge in these areas.

Prior to pursuing my Masters, I amassed three years of professional experience as a Network Engineer in the Data Center - Software Defined Networking domain at Cisco in Bangalore, India. 
During my tenure there, I focused on Linux-based Distributed Computing platforms, DevOps technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, and Cloud Computing utilizing AWS and Azure alongside data center networking.

At Cisco, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse range of customers globally and was tasked with mentoring and ramping up multiple engineers within the team. I also demonstrated leadership and technical acumen by successfully leading and developing over 30 automation projects, utilizing a variety of programming languages and technologies such as Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch. These projects aimed to streamline troubleshooting for engineers and automate log analysis across various technologies.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a passion for Formula 1 Racing and enjoy participating in quizzes as a hobby.
