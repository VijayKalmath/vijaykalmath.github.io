I am an M.S. student in Data Science at Columbia University.My work is focused on deep learning research and large language models. 

As an NLP - Machine Learning Engineer at Lexalytics, a leading multi-lingual AI company, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of deep learning and NLP. 

During my time at Columbia, I achieved significant milestones that highlight my expertise and passion for deep learning and NLP, including:

1. Serving as a Machine Learning Researcher under the supervision of Professor Michael Parrott on the prestigious AI Modelshare project, where I contributed to cutting-edge research in machine learning.

2. Working as a Deep Learning Researcher with Dr. Igor Kadota at Columbia University, where I developed convLSTM models to predict micro-climate patterns based on radar transmission data, showcasing my skills in applying deep learning techniques to real-world problems.

3. Being appointed as a Course Assistant for Deep Learning and Neural Networks as well as Machine Learning Security courses in the esteemed Columbia AI Executive Program, demonstrating my aptitude for teaching and sharing my expertise in these specialized areas of study.

These experiences reflect my dedication to advancing the field of deep learning and NLP through research, practical applications, and knowledge-sharing, and highlight my commitment to excellence in my academic and professional pursuits.

My current research interests revolve around representation models and large language models, with a particular emphasis on model compression techniques and adversarial attacks.

Prior to pursuing my Masters, I amassed three years of professional experience as a Network Engineer in the Data Center - Software Defined Networking domain at Cisco in Bangalore, India. 
During my tenure there, I focused on Linux-based Distributed Computing platforms, DevOps technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, and Cloud Computing utilizing AWS and Azure alongside data center networking.

At Cisco, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse range of customers globally and was tasked with mentoring and ramping up multiple engineers within the team. I also demonstrated leadership and technical acumen by successfully leading and developing over 30 automation projects, utilizing a variety of programming languages and technologies such as Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch. These projects aimed to streamline troubleshooting for engineers and automate log analysis across various technologies.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a passion for Formula 1 Racing and enjoy participating in quizzes as a hobby.
