I am an M.S. student in Data Science at Columbia University. My work is focused on deep learning research and large language models. 

As an NLP - Machine Learning Engineer at [Lexalytics](https://www.lexalytics.com/), a leading multi-lingual AI company, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of deep learning and NLP. 

At Columbia, I built my expertise in deep learning and nlp by : 

1. Serving as a Machine Learning Researcher under the supervision of Professor Michael Parrott on the [AI Modelshare](https://www.modelshare.ai/) project.

2. Working as a Deep Learning Researcher with Dr. Igor Kadota, where I developed convLSTM models to predict micro-climate patterns based on radar transmission data.

3. Building course work as a Course Assistant for Deep Learning and Neural Networks as well as Machine Learning Security courses in the esteemed Columbia AI Executive Program.

These experiences reflect my dedication to advancing the field of deep learning and NLP through research, practical applications, and knowledge-sharing, and highlight my commitment to excellence in my academic and professional pursuits.

My current research interests revolve around representation models and large language models, with a particular emphasis on model compression techniques and adversarial attacks.
