I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at [Columbia University](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/) graduating in Decemeber 2022. 

I am currently working as a `Deep Learning Research Assistant` at Columbia University and I am looking for full-time roles in the machine learning/ deep learning domain wherein I can combine my previous work experience and data science knowledge to create a significant impact. 

My work and studies at Columbia has been mainly focused on Deep Learning from projects involving standard Convolutional Neural Networks , Time Distributed ConvLSTMs to Attention based Models. I also had the oppurutunity to work as a Course Assistant for the course `Deep Learning and Neural Networks` and `Machine Learning Security` in the Columbia AI Exec Program.

Prior to my Masters , I worked in `Cisco` in Bangalore,India for 3 Years as a Techincal Consulting Engineer in the Software Defined Networking Domain and focused on DevOps Technologies like Docker,Kubernetes etc.. . At Cisco I got opprutunites to work with many cisco customers across the globe and got to mentor and ramp up multiple engineers for the Team.

I have lead around `25+` Automation Projects within Cisco built upon Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch and won multiple hackathons. 

Aside from work , I am avid fan of Formula 1 Racing and love listening to Old school Hindi Music and Western Classicals.
