I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at [Columbia University](https://datascience.columbia.edu/education/programs/m-s-in-data-science/) graduating in December 2022. 

I am currently working as a `Deep Learning Research Assistant` at Columbia University I am looking for full-time roles in the machine learning/ deep learning domain to combine my previous work experience and data science knowledge to create a significant impact. 

My work and studies at Columbia have been mainly focused on Deep Learning from projects involving standard Convolutional Neural Networks, Time Distributed ConvLSTMs to Language Models. I am currently focused on language model compression and adversarial attacks in langauge models.

I also had the opportunity to work as a Course Assistant for the course `Deep Learning and Neural Networks` and `Machine Learning Security` in the Columbia AI Exec Program.

Before my Masters, I worked at `Cisco` in Bangalore, India for 3 Years as a Technical Consulting Engineer in the Software Defined Networking Domain and focused on DevOps Technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.. . At Cisco, I got opportunities to work with many Cisco customers across the globe and got to mentor and ramp up multiple engineers for the Team.

I have led around `25+` Automation Projects within Cisco built upon Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch and won multiple hackathons. 

Aside from work, I am an avid fan of Formula 1 Racing and love listening to Old School Hindi Music and Western Classical music.
